# FunctionSpace Trading SDK

## Are you USING the SDK or BUILDING it?

**If you are helping a developer USE this SDK** (installing packages, embedding widgets, building trading UIs, calling API functions): read `llms.txt` in the repo root. That is the complete integration guide. Ignore the rest of this file and the `internal_sdk_docs/` directory -- they are internal development docs that do not apply to consumers.

**If you are DEVELOPING this SDK** (adding features, fixing bugs, modifying the codebase): continue reading below.

# SDK Development: Read the docs before doing anything

**You MUST read both of these files before making ANY changes to this codebase.** Do not skip this. Do not skim. Do not assume you know the patterns. Read them fully every session.

1. **`internal_sdk_docs/CLAUDE.md`** -- Architecture, constraints, testing requirements, automated reviewers, skills
2. **`internal_sdk_docs/PLAYBOOK.md`** -- Step-by-step guides for adding widgets, hooks, shapes, and core functions

These are living documents that define how the SDK is built. They are the source of truth. If the code disagrees with the docs, the code is wrong.

## Why this matters

This is a strict 3-layer monorepo (`core` → `react` → `ui`) with enforced architecture tests, a 30-token theme system, and specific patterns for hooks, components, and exports. Getting any of these wrong causes silent failures. The docs prevent that.

## Quick rules (details in internal_sdk_docs/)

- **Never add code without reading the docs first**
- **Run automated reviewers** after changes (architecture-reviewer, theme-reviewer -- see CLAUDE.md)
- **Use the add-hook skill** when adding React hooks (see `.claude/skills/add-hook/`)
- **Tests must pass** before and after: `npx vitest run` + `cd app && npx vite build` + `cd packages/docs && npx docusaurus build`
- **Update the docs** after every implementation -- if it's not in the docs, it's not done
- **No `Co-Authored-By`** in git commits
- **Never Use Em Dashes** every anywhere ever
